## Overview

This zsh plugin adds widgets based on [fzf-widgets][fzf-widgets-link] for navigating
files and directories based on [TMSU][tmsu-link] tags.

This is a WIP and currently only provides cd'ing into tagged directories.

## Installation

You will need [fzf-widgets][fzf-widgets-link] loaded in your zsh to use this plugin.

If you use zplug, the following lines are required:

```zsh
zplug 'ytet5uy4/fzf-widgets'

zplug 'crater2150/tmsu-fzf'
```

## Requirements

- [fzf-widgets][fzf-widgets-link] 
- [TMSU][tmsu-link]

## Widgets

To use the provided widgets, bind them to a key in your zshrc, e.g.
```zsh
bindkey "^t" tmsu-fzf-change-directory
```

### `tmsu-fzf-change-directory`
Prompts for tags until `<done>` is selected. Then all directories matching the
tags are listed. Select one to change to it.
